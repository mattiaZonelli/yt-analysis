# Youtube, COVID-19 and social dynamics
Following the spread of Covid-19, an analysis was carried out on the Youtube platform on how the interest and involvement of users in relation to the issue of the pandemic has evolved. A mathematical evaluation of user behavior and activities was carried out, observing their distribution over time and their evolution. We also studied how users reacted to the publication of videos and what topics were used most frequently.
The diffusion process has been quantified through an epidemic model trying to break down the growth rate of the users involved.
In order to analyze the data in greater detail, the users were then divided into subgroups according to their frequency of interaction. In fact, through standard community partitioning algorithms, the four most numerous communities were examined. For each community both the evolution of the activities of the users over time and the permanence in the group, finding similar characteristics to the echo chambers. The result suggests that a very low lifetime prevails among most users. To each subgroup, the epidemic model is applied once again, in which we note the exponential growth in the number of people involved in the process of using pandemic-related content.
